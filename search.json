Training school on querying data aggregated in the ARIADNE infrastructure and their spatial analysis in R\n\n\nJoin us in Brno for a five-day ‘atRium’ training school in computational archaeology, where you will gain essential coding skills in the R programming language, knowledge of archaeological data integrated into the ARIADNE research infrastructure, and fundamental spatial data analysis expertise. As large amounts of archaeological data have become available, spatial analysis techniques may offer valuable insights into past human behaviour and settlement patterns. Our programme is designed to deepen your understanding of computational methods in archaeology, focusing on working in a reproducible manner using the R programming language and environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe training school is part of a trans-national access scheme provided by the ATRIUM Project, hosted by the Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) research infrastructure at the Institute of Archaeology, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno.\n\nFeel free to distribute the flyer in PDF or PNG."

Access is facilitated through the comprehensive data catalogue ARIADNE Portal (see the short video below for more details) and directly through a SPARQL endpoint to the linked-open data triple store, the ARIADNE Knowledge Base.\nOne of the goals of the training school is to enable programmatic access to these resources by introducing the basics of knowledge representation in the triple store, explaining the ARIADNE AO-Cat Ontology, and providing training in building SPARQL queries.\n\n\n\nAIS CR\nThe Archaeological Information System of the Czech Republic (AIS CR) is a research infrastructure integrating digital resources and services on archaeology in the Czech Republic, and as such is one of many data providers in the ARIADNE Research Infrastructure. AIS CR is jointly operated by the Institutes of Archaeology of the Czech Academy of Sciences in Brno (IAB) and Prague (IAP)."
